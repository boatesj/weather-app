### Error Handling

The app includes robust error handling mechanisms to enhance user experience:

- **Empty City Field**: If the user attempts to search for weather information without entering a city name, the app prompts the user to enter a city name.

![If the city field is empty on click](/assets/images/weatherApp-err.png)

- **Invalid City Name**: If a user enters a city name that cannot be found, the app displays a friendly error message informing the user that the city was not found and suggests checking the spelling.

![If a city cannot be found](/assets/images/weatherApp-4.png)

Here is the code that performs the check, handles any errors, and provides a clear, friendly message to guide the user on what to do next.

```javascript

async function getWeatherData(city) {
    const apiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}`;
    const response = await fetch(apiUrl);

    if (!response.ok) {
        const { cod, message } = await response.json();
        if (cod === "404") {
            throw new Error(`City not found. Please check the city name and try again.`);
        } else {
            throw new Error(`Error ${cod}: ${message}`);
        }
    }

    return await response.json();
}
```
